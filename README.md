Small Eurorack case based on Makerbeam XL profiles.

The case is not compatible with all Eurorack modules. But it is compatible with my own modules where the circuits are max 102mm long.
I use the Makerbeam XL profiles because they are cheap, 14 euro (excl. shipping) for 4 beams of 360mm which are needed for this case, and it takes regular M3 hex nuts as sliding nuts. 
All screws are 6mm M3, for modules as well as for the case construction. No glue is used. All panels are easily removable.

I created the design in the code editor. The SVG has the size of a multiplex panel of 600 x 300 mm.
To send it to my local Lasercutter service, I convert the SVG to DXF on the web. The thickness of the multiplex need to be 3mm.
